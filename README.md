Solution of 450 DSA 

How to use it?
Each folder in this repository is mention with the topic and inside of it there is solution along with questions from 450 DSA
solution + website link to(python code visualizer)

How it is different then any others solution?
The main difference in this solution is, it has different way to solve the same question like bruteforce, recursive, iterative, mathematical etc. So at First i used brute force or any basic method that i came up with to solve the problem, then its optimization and its variations, then recursive or iterative if possible, and at last best/efficient Method. So the thought process will not only align on best method but also on the brute force which is basic need or foundation for any programmer to have a problem solving mind.
